The two search queries that I had chosen for this assignment were the Flint Water Crisis
and the War in Ukraine/Russia as I wanted to see how the differnet news media coverage varies in domestic and international 
conflicts. 
What I found was that while both were different in the scope of problems in the world they were both similar in how they were covered in YouTube
searches as they both had higher instances of Location and the type of issue at hand, with War being a prominent theme in Ukraine/Russia and
a crisis for Flint, Michigan. 

The search queries that I had used for both were simple but both yielded different results as I had used keywords such as "Flint", "Water", "WaterCrisis", "Michigan", "Ukraine", "War", and "Russia". The reason for why I chose these two topics was to compare and contrast how a domestic issue is labeled a crisis and how it is seen within the top search queries in YouTube and make the comparison with a war in Ukraine which is relatively recent as despite it stopping being displayed in media the Flint Water Crisis is ongoing with many of the citizens still not having access to clean drinking water fromt their homes. 

Looking at their word clouds we can see that both yielded somewhat similar results in the mentioning of a few key words with the places of where it was happening appearing larger than others but I also noted that there is a higher occurance of the actors in the Ukraine/Russia bubble with more mentions of President Putin and of attacks happening while with Flint there was no mention of any direct actors at least in the search query and I found this to be of importance as there is still no one being held accountable for the crisis that is still affecting many people in Flint. The reasons for these patterns is that the coverage only stops at a certain point as less people become intersted in these types of events and associate only a few words with these types of events as they are not directly affecting them. 

I think the way I could improve this research is by possibly filtering to only include information from the last 3 years for Flint and the last year for the Ukraine War and compare them then. 

There is nothing that stands out to me than I expected before performing this lab as seeing them in the Standing ROck example prepared me enough to see what I had found, if there is anything it is maybe that there was more instances of the location than I had expected but based on my search criteria this was to be expected.
