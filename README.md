The two search queries that I had chosen for this assignment were the Flint Water Crisis
and the War in Ukraine/Russia, as I wanted to see how the different news media coverage varies in domestic and international 
conflicts. 
What I found was that while both were different in the scope of problems in the world, they were both similar in how they were covered on YouTube
searches as they both had higher instances of Location and the type of issue at hand, with War being a prominent theme in Ukraine/Russia and
a crisis for Flint, Michigan. 

The search queries that I used for both were simple, but both yielded different results as I had used keywords such as "Flint," "Water," "WaterCrisis," "Michigan," "Ukraine," "War," and "Russia." The reason why I chose these two topics was to compare and contrast how a domestic issue has labeled a crisis and how it is seen within the top search queries on YouTube and make the comparison with a war in Ukraine, which is relatively recent despite it stopping being displayed in media the Flint Water Crisis is ongoing with many of the citizens still not having access to clean drinking water from their homes. 

Looking at their word clouds, we can see that both yielded somewhat similar results in mentioning a few keywords, with the places where it happened appearing larger than others. Still, I also noted that there is a higher occurrence of the actors in the Ukraine/Russia bubble with more mentions of President Putin and attacks happening, while with Flint, there was no mention of any direct actors, at least in the search query. I found this to be important as no one is held accountable for the crisis affecting many people in Flint. The reason for these patterns is that the coverage only stops at a certain point as fewer people become interested in these events and associate only a few words with them as they do not directly affect them. 

I think I could improve this research by possibly filtering to include only information from the last three years for Flint and the last year for the Ukraine War and comparing them then. 

There is nothing that stands out to me than I expected before performing this lab as seeing them in the Standing Rock example prepared me enough to see what I had found; if there is anything, it is maybe that there were more instances of the Location than I had expected, but based on my search criteria this was to be expected.
